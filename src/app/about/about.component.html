        <p class="bio-text">
          Hi, Iâ€™m Syed Zain Ali Shahâ€”a software engineer with a passion for turning ideas into functional, impactful products. Originally from Karachi, Pakistan, I grew up in a lively city that shaped my love for problem-solving and adaptability. Being the youngest of three brothers, Iâ€™ve always had great role models to look up to, which fueled my drive to carve out my own path.
          <br><br>

          I graduated from FAST NUCES, one of Pakistanâ€™s top universities, where I learned how to survive intense coding marathons and mastered the art of debugging at 3 a.m. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Philipps-UniversitÃ¤t Marburg, Germany, continuing my journey of exploring new technologies and growing my expertise.
          <br><br>
          
          Professionally, Iâ€™ve worked at GhangorCloud, a cybersecurity firm based in Silicon Valley, where I developed user analytics features, built visually rich interfaces with Angular, and optimized backend systems with Java Spring Boot. Iâ€™ve also had fun experimenting with projects like a YOLOv4-powered trash detection system, a MERN-stack e-commerce website, and even a 3D Pong game. These experiences have taught me that software development isnâ€™t just about codingâ€”itâ€™s about solving real-world problems and creating experiences people love.
          <br><br>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me gardening. Thereâ€™s something incredibly rewarding about growing plantsâ€”itâ€™s like debugging, but with sunlight and water. One of my dreams is to combine my love for tech and sustainability, maybe by developing AI-driven solutions for environmental challenges.
          <br><br>
          So, whether itâ€™s building apps, diving into AI, or simply growing the perfect tomatoes, Iâ€™m always excited to create and learn something new.
         </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">My Passion Project</h2>
          <p class="passion-text">I have a deep love for storytelling, pop culture, and community building. Along with my friends, I co-organize Pakistanâ€™s biggest comic convention, creating a space where fans, artists, and creators can connect and celebrate their favorite worlds. Bringing these events to life has been an incredible journeyâ€”one that blends creativity, collaboration, and a shared passion for comics, gaming, and pop culture.

  description = "A software engineer with a passion for turning ideas into functional, impactful products. Originally from Karachi, Pakistan, I grew up in a lively city that shaped my love for problem-solving and adaptability. Being the youngest of three brothers, I’ve always had great role models to look up to, which fueled my drive to carve out my own path. I graduated from FAST NUCES, one of Pakistan’s top universities, where I learned how to survive intense coding marathons and mastered the art of debugging at 3 a.m. Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany, continuing my journey of exploring new technologies and growing my expertise. Professionally, I’ve worked at GhangorCloud, a cybersecurity firm based in Silicon Valley, where I developed user analytics features, built visually rich interfaces with Angular, and optimized backend systems with Java Spring Boot. I’ve also had fun experimenting with projects like a YOLOv4-powered trash detection system, a MERN-stack e-commerce website, and even a 3D Pong game. These experiences have taught me that software development isn’t just about coding—it’s about solving real-world problems and creating experiences people love. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me gardening. There’s something incredibly rewarding about growing plants—it’s like debugging, but with sunlight and water. One of my dreams is to combine my love for tech and sustainability, maybe by developing AI-driven solutions for environmental challenges. So, whether it’s building apps, diving into AI, or simply growing the perfect tomatoes, I’m always excited to create and learn something new."
